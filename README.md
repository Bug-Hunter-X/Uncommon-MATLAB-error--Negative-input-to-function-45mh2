This repository contains a MATLAB function that demonstrates an uncommon error related to handling negative inputs. The function `myFunction` checks for negative input values and throws an error if encountered. However, this error is not very descriptive. A solution is also provided that uses a try-catch block to handle the error and provide a more informative message. The solution also demonstrates more robust error handling.
